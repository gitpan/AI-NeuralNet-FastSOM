- redo proto.h.. again!

- "passing argument 3 of 'Perl_newXS' discards qualifiers
   from pointer target type"

- test older perls. at least drop version requirement back as far as will
  work with what we have now.

- clean up!

- figure out how to call perl's exp(), log() and getpid() functions.
