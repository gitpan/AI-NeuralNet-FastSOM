- redo proto.h.. again!

- "cannot take sizeof void"

- test older perls. at least drop version requirement back as far as will
  work with what we have now.

- clean up!

- clean up most instances of newAV() with av_undef().
  in other words, seek and destroy memory leaks!

- figure out how to call perl's exp(), log() and getpid() functions.
