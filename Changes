Revision history for Perl extension AI::NeuralNet::FastSOM.

0.12  Sat Aug 15 14:24:50 2009
	- will now pass -Wall -Wextra -ansi -Wdeclaration-after-statement
	  (locally anyway)
	- wrapped newSVpvs in INT2PTR to hopefully satisfy some platforms
	- bumped perl require back up to 5.8.0 for now
	- defined PERL_MAGIC_tied for older perls
	- changed hv_fetchs() to hv_fetch() for older perls
	- hacked in defines for Newx() and friends for older perls
	- changed newSVpvs() to newSVpvn() for older perls
	- created seperate typemap for older perls, along with Makefile.PL
	  modification to use it before 5.8.0
	- added requirement for Storable which is non-core in older perls
	- moved perl require back down to 5.6.2

0.11  Sun Aug  9 10:04:19 2009
	- casting newSVpvs() to SV* to satisfy at least one platform
	- added 'const char *' to typemap for older perls
	- removed a few unneeded casts to internal types
	- moved DESTROY methods to superclass, thus fixing missing
	  Hexa::DESTROY and consolidating common code
	- consolidated neighbors code
	- general housekeeping

0.10  Fri Aug  7 09:11:39 2009
	- no longer relying on sizeof(void)
	- removed a bit of old test code
	- one more PTR2INT conversion
	- experimentally dropped perl require to 5.6.2
	- hopefully fixed a few casting problems for some platforms

0.09  Wed Aug  5 20:26:17 2009
	- removed several temporary AVs in train(), fixing massive
	  memory leak
	- removed another temp AV in _bmu_guts(), fixing another
	  memory leak
	- added pointer <-> IV conversions, hopefully fixing tons of
	  warnings on platforms where ivsize != ptrsize
	- added macros to speed up pointer conversions
	- consolidated bmu code in ::FastSOM

0.08  Fri Jul 31 16:17:32 2009
	- removed leading underscore from struct member names
	- removed all // comments, just in case...
	- changed all native type (int,double) to perl types (IV,NV)
	- fixed couple of instances of calling back to perl to get
	  stuff from c structs
	- reworked Storable support

0.07  Sat Jul 25 14:18:03 2009
	- clean up things a bit
	- now using Atol() instead of atoi()
	- now using Drand01() instead of rand()
	- now using seedDrand01() instead of srand()
	- fixed problem with not using all training vectors, or some twice
	- removed non-core Data::Dumper from tests
	- added tests for store/retrieve via Storable
	- first public release

0.06  Wed Jul 22 12:07:25 2009
	- removed AI::NN::FSOM::ARRAY, ::MAP, and ::VECTOR modules
	- removed Inline::C code from remaining modules
	- removed dependence on non-core parent.pm
	- removed remaining Inline::C macros and INLINE.h
	- moved train() into C
	- now parsing input_ and output_dim parameters (finally!)

0.05  Mon Jul 20 13:20:06 2009
	- re-added support for labels, originally in AI::NN::SOM
	- added original AI::NN::SOM test suite (and it works!)

0.04  Sat Jul 18 16:45:27 2009
	- removed dependence on Inline::C
	- minor refactor

0.03  Sat Jul 18 09:30:08 2009
	- created wrappers for most c-level stuff

0.02  Wed Jul 15 18:56:13 2009
	- moved data structures into C structs

0.01  Thu Jul  2 09:07:01 2009
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-AXn AI::NeuralNet::FastSOM
