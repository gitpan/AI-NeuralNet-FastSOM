 * References
 * ==========
 * 
 * Each of Rect, Map, Array, and Vector contains a member 'ref' which is
 * an SV* pointing to an RV. The RV can be returned directly to perl-land
 * after being blessed into its respective class.
 * 
 * The RV references an SV containing an IV. The IV is set to the base
 * address of its component structure. This is so the class code can know
 * which instance of the class is being referred to on callback.
 * 
 * The reference count of the SV has its initial reference count set to one,
 * representing its parents ownership. If a parent dies or a perl-land
 * reference is taken of any componenet, its reference count should
 * be adjusted accordingly.
 * 
 * When the count reaches zero perl will call the classes DESTROY method,
 * at which point we can decrease the reference count on each child and
 * free the component structure.
 * 
 * The intent of all this reference count tom-foolery is to keep the
 * component structures from disappearing from underneath perl-land
 * references to them. As a bonus, we get a neat destruction mechanism
 * without having to reimplement OOP in C.

 *

 * a copy of 'ref' will be returned to the perl side on request, and the
 * tied array interface can be use to access the members of this struct.
 *
 * 'Z' is of course the number of doubles in the 'element' array.
